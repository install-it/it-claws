<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

it-claws is a Python-based tool that automatically downloads the latest PC hardware drivers, diagnostic tools, and common software from official vendor websites. Using Selenium for browser automation and httpx for static requests, it navigates vendor sites to retrieve up-to-date installation packages — suitable for staging driver packs for enterprise deployment.

Unlike simple download utilities, it-claws runs concurrently with configurable retry logic, supports dynamic and static page scraping, and can pack everything into a compressed ZIP archive via `libarchive`.

The tool serves as a companion to [install-it](https://github.com/install-it/install-it/). See the [Usage](#usage) section for more information.

it-claws also supports **Docker** deployment with tmpfs RAM disk and automated cloud upload via rclone. See [scripts](scripts/) for the automation pipeline.

<!-- USAGE -->

## Usage

### Basic flow

1. **Select targets**
   - Use `-t` to specify space-separated target names
   - Use `-i` for interactive selection
   - Use `--all` to select all targets
   - Use `--target-from <file>` to load a preset text file

2. **Download**
   - The tool resolves download URLs (static or dynamic)
   - Files are downloaded concurrently with configurable retries

3. **Archive & output**
   - Results are staged in the output directory
   - Optionally pack into a compressed ZIP archive

### Selecting targets

```sh
it-claws -t "AMD Chipset Drivers" "Realtek HD Universal Audio"
it-claws -i
it-claws --all
```

Use a preset file (one target per line, `#` for comments):

```sh
it-claws --target-from presets/default.txt
```

Combine with interactive to tweak the preset before running:

```sh
it-claws --target-from presets/default.txt -i
```

### Output options

```sh
it-claws -o ./my-drivers --max-concurrent 10
```

### Resilience options

```sh
it-claws --max-concurrent 10 --retries 2
```

- `--max-concurrent`: parallel downloads (default: `3`, `1` = sequential)
- `--retries`: retry attempts per failed download (default: `1`)

### Archiving options

```sh
it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip --zip-include install-it/conf --compress-level 9
```

- `-z` / `--zip PATH`: destination for the output ZIP archive
- `--zip-include SOURCE[=LAYOUT]`: additional files or directories to include in the archive (can be specified multiple times). The `<source>[=<layout>]` syntax lets you map a source path to a custom entry name inside the ZIP. For example, `install-it/conf=settings` adds the contents of `install-it/conf` under a `settings/` prefix inside the archive.
- `--zip-prefix PREFIX`: control how the output directory is represented in the ZIP. By default, the output directory name is stripped from archive paths. Specify a name to prefix all entries (e.g. `--zip-prefix pkg` places entries under `pkg/`).
- `-l` / `--compress-level`: compression level `0`–`9` (default: `5`)
- `--manifest`: generate a `manifest.json` file at the root of the ZIP archive

### How zip entries are determined

By default, the output directory name is stripped from archive paths. Entries are placed directly under the archive root:

```sh
it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip
# → zip contains: network/..., display/...  (downloads/ prefix stripped)
```

Use `--zip-prefix` to add a custom prefix to all entries:

```sh
it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip --zip-prefix drivers
# → zip contains: drivers/network/..., drivers/display/...
```

Additional files or directories can be included with `--zip-include`. Each flag accepts a single source path, optionally followed by `=<layout>` to remap the entry name inside the archive:

```sh
it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip --zip-include install-it/conf
# → zip contains: network/..., display/... + install-it/conf/...

it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip --zip-include install-it/conf=settings
# → zip contains: network/..., display/... + settings/...  (remapped from install-it/conf)
```

You can specify `--zip-include` multiple times to include several paths:

```sh
it-claws -o ./downloads -z ./driver-pack.zip \
  --zip-include install-it/conf \
  --zip-include scripts/startup
# → zip contains: network/..., display/... + install-it/conf/... + scripts/startup/...
```

When the same directory is included via both `-o` and `--zip-include`, or when two `--zip-include` paths overlap, the entries are merged without duplication.

<!-- DEPLOYMENT -->

## Deployment

This project can be deployed via Docker with tmpfs RAM disk and automated rclone upload. See [`scripts/`](scripts/) for the automation pipeline and environment variable reference.

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged \
  -v /my/host/config:/config \
  -e RC_REMOTE_PATH="onedrive:PC_Deployments" \
  -e RETRIES="2" \
  -e COMPRESS_LEVEL="9" \
  it-claws
```

Override the default command:

```bash
docker run --name=it-claws \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/install-it/it-claws:latest \
  it-claws -t "AMD Chipset Drivers" "Realtek HD Universal Audio"
```
